# P2P Web Escrow

This project was conceibed for Kleros Hackathon 2020, by a group of Open Justice lovers that also love (and build) an app called Defiant.

Defiant is a non-custodial wallet that was born with a P2P marketplace as its very heart. Nowadays it has plenty more features, but the P2P is an important one for us. But many of our users are still reluctant to use the P2P. They are missing something. Entering: Kleros Escrow.  

## An Escrow for a P2P Marketplace

For quite some time already, we've been lookin for a way to secure our users' experience while selling or buying through the P2P marketplace. When we heard of Kleros Escrow, we knew it was ideal for this matter.

# Why we want to get this prize
Because we've been building Defiant as a solution to real people problems for more than a year already, using only our own funds and some grants we've been awarded. So we would use the prize entirely to afford the integration of Kleros Escrow to our P2P marketplace, which is one of the features that both ourselves and our users have been expecting and asking for during months.
